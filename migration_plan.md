# Python 3.13 Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan for migrating the "concentrate" project to Python 3.12.

## 1. Code Modernization

*   **Automated Tooling:** Use `pyupgrade` to automatically upgrade the syntax to be more modern.
    ```bash
- [x]     pip install pyupgrade
- [x]     pyupgrade **/*.py
    ```
*   **Linter:** Use a linter like `ruff` to identify potential issues and enforce code style.
    ```bash
- [x]     pip install ruff
- [x]     ruff check . --fix
    ```
## 2. Manual Code Review

*   **Key Areas:**
- [ ]     *   `GUI.py`: GUI toolkits can have significant breaking changes. We will need to carefully review this file.
- [ ]     *   `evolve_memory.pkl`: The `pickle` format is not guaranteed to be compatible across Python versions. We may need to re-generate this file or find an alternative serialization method.
- [ ]     *   String handling, division, and dictionary operations: These are areas where Python 3 has introduced changes.

## 3. Testing

- [ ] *   **New Tests:** We will create new tests to ensure the core functionality of the application works as expected after the migration.

## 4. Documentation

- [ ] *   **Update `README.md`:** Update the `README.md` file to reflect the changes made and provide instructions on how to run the project with Python 3.12.
